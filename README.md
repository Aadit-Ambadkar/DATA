# DATA: Digital Addiction Tracking App

Digital Addiction is an underrecognized mental illness which affects nearly 61% of all people with access to internet, a majority of whom are teens under the age of 18. In comparison only about 6% of adults are alcoholics. Apps like I am Sober for alcohol addictions exist, so why not for digital addiction? It's time to start battling digital addiction.

DATA serves as a recovery tracker app and a combatant app, offering an inbuilt rewards system which (provided funding which I don't have) can scale easily to monetary rewards. Like most recovery apps, DATA relies on user honesty, which means it can't be used as a third-party tracking app, and thus protects user privacy.

However, DATA builds beyond traditional apps by offering services like a stagered system. Moreover, due to the influence that the internet has on, tracking is by time spent per day, and not time since last usage.

So to anyone looking to recover from a digital addiction, try DATA.
